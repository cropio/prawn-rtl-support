# Prawn::Rtl::Support

This gem provide bidirectional text support for Prawn. It uses Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm for displaying text from [TwitterCldr::Shared::Bidi](https://github.com/twitter/twitter-cldr-rb) and connect arabic letters using [Arabic Letter Connector](https://github.com/staii/arabic-letter-connector). Prawn patching is minimal, we patch only [`Prawn::Text::Formatted::Box#original_text`](https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn/blob/master/lib/prawn/text/formatted/box.rb#L367). 

## Motivation

Ruby and Rails internally provide unicode string normalization and store normalized letters inside. But Prawn don't connect arabic glyphs back and don't suport mixet LTR and RTL string. This gem add this suport. 

## Acknowledgment
This gem use same code as [Arabic Letter Connector](https://github.com/staii/arabic-letter-connector) by [@staii](https://github.com/staii) and therefore based on [Arabic-Prawn](https://rubygems.org/gems/Arabic-Prawn/versions/0.0.1) by Dynamix Solutions (Ahmed Nasser).
